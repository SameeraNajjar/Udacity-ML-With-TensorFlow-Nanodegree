# Finding Donors for CharityML

## Overview
This project leverages supervised learning techniques to predict which individuals in the Census dataset earn more than $50,000 per year. This prediction aids CharityML, a non-profit organization, in identifying potential donors. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model evaluation, optimization, and feature importance analysis.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Calculate the total number of records.
   - Determine the number of individuals with income >$50,000 and <=$50,000.
   - Calculate the percentage of individuals with income >$50,000.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Apply one-hot encoding to categorical features.
   - Convert income data into binary labels.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Naive Predictor Benchmark**
   - Establish a baseline using a naive predictor (assumes all individuals earn >$50,000).
   - Calculate accuracy and F1 score to compare with actual models.

4. **Model Selection and Evaluation**
   - Implement and evaluate the following supervised learning models:
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - AdaBoost Classifier
   - Assess each model's pros and cons based on accuracy, F1 score, and training time.

5. **Model Optimization**
   - Select the best-performing model based on accuracy and F1 score.
   - Use grid search to optimize hyperparameters.

6. **Feature Importance**
   - Extract feature importances from the model.
   - Rank the top five most important features for predicting income.
   - Compare model performance using only the top five features vs. the entire feature set.

7. **Final Model Evaluation**
   - Report accuracy and F1 score for both unoptimized and optimized models.
   - Compare final model performance with the naive predictor and earlier models.

## Running the Project

    Data Preparation
        Load the Census dataset.
        Perform one-hot encoding and data preprocessing.
        Split the data into training and testing sets.

    Model Training and Evaluation
        Train the models and evaluate their performance.
        Compare results using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

    Model Optimization
        Perform grid search optimization on the selected model.
        Evaluate the optimized modelâ€™s performance.

    Feature Importance
        Analyze feature importance from the chosen model.
        Experiment with a reduced feature set and observe any impact on model performance.

Results

    The final optimized model shows substantial improvements over the naive predictor.
    Feature importance analysis reveals the most influential variables in income prediction.

Conclusion

This project applies supervised learning techniques to a practical classification task. By selecting and optimizing models, it achieves better predictive accuracy, making it an effective tool for identifying potential donors for CharityML.

# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on identifying customer segments within a dataset using unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and KMeans clustering. The goal is to help businesses understand different groups of customers based on purchasing behavior and demographic information.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand the structure and features.
   - Calculate basic statistics and identify potential patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
   - Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA to capture the most significant patterns in the data.

3. **Model Implementation**
   - Apply KMeans clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
   - Evaluate the performance of the clustering model and assess the quality of the identified segments.

4. **Feature Importance**
   - Analyze the importance of different features in forming the clusters.
   - Use visualizations to better understand the customer segments and their defining characteristics.

## Data Disclaimer

The data used in this project is real and contains sensitive information. Due to privacy and confidentiality restrictions, the dataset cannot be shared publicly. The project code is available, but you will need to provide your own dataset to replicate the results.

## Installation

You will need the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter notebook`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Project
1. Data Preparation
    - Load your dataset and ensure it is properly formatted.
    - Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling features.

2. Model Training
    - Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
    - Train the KMeans clustering model to identify customer segments.

3. Evaluation
    - Analyze and visualize the customer segments.
    - Use the model to gain insights into different groups of customers.

## Results
- The final model successfully identifies distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
- Visualizations illustrate the characteristics of each segment and help provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on real-world data. The customer segments identified can help businesses tailor their marketing and sales strategies to better meet the needs of their diverse customer base.
